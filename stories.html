                                Hetzner and GitHub Actions are both popular tools in the DevOps ecosystem, and they complement each other well in various aspects of the development and deployment pipeline.
                                That's why I choose them to begin my Devops Journey. It is clear to me that a lots will choose AWS (because of their popularity)
                                and Gitlab( it is free, why not?). First AWS free tier is not really free if you have no idea what you are doing with it, so it is not really
                                something I suggest for a beginner, and you are really have to take care of the billing. Hetzner based in Germany, and it is not
                                too bad to support the local cloud :D.<br/>
                                Gitlab is really popular in corporation but in order to take care of self hosted runner
                                then I thinks it is not really good for beginner. In case you have some self hosted Gitlab cloud server somewhere to runner
                                24/7 then it is fine.<br/>
                                Anyway, the first CI/CD of mine are used with these combo. Using Terraform to provision a server on Hetzner that runs
                                Analytical Tools, which used Flask, for my wife. I am pretty happy with it as it is a first step of mine on this devops/cloud journey.

                            It would be nice if everyone can understand what is the difference between
                            these jobs.<br/>
                            Helpdesk typically deal with problems that involve the desktop/laptop and pheripherals
                            (mouse, headphone, and maybe even PRINTER (the devil if you know)), basically the work involves
                            more with the users.<br/>
                            Sysadmin keeps the whole IT infrastructure going, scripting, maintaining, updating the 
                            system so that it won't get down whenever happens (hacking,attacking). Logging and 
                            Data collecting are also part of your jobs incase your Product Owner/Technical IT Manager
                            demands it.<br/>
                            So now you understand what is the difference between two of them, then what will you choose?

                                I was wondering that myself too. In 2018-2019, during the time, 
                                I was working as an intern at Future Electronics in Munich. 
                                I had lots of opportunities to understand what can I do 
                                after finishing my degree in ET/IT.<br/>
                                I had lots of chance to tinkering with PCG from multiple famous manufacturers like NXP
                                , ON Semiconductor, Texas Instruments, etc. and it involves lots of embedding 
                                and C Programming. 
                                It was more fun for me to combine the PCB Boards with lots of sensors, 
                                and to see that it can do many types of application 
                                (like how the hell can the light turn on or the temps of your hand 
                                when you hover your hand?)<br/>
                                So yeah, it would be nice if EE can code, 
                                and of course it is possible that you can do that full time too.<br/>
