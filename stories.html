                                Hetzner and GitHub Actions are both popular tools in the DevOps ecosystem, and they complement each other well in various aspects of the development and deployment pipeline. Here are some reasons why they are considered beneficial for DevOps:<br/>

                                <strong>Cost-effective</strong>: Hetzner offers competitive pricing for its cloud services, making it an attractive option for startups and small to medium-sized businesses looking to minimize infrastructure costs. GitHub Actions provides a generous free tier for CI/CD workflows, which can further reduce operational expenses.<br/>

                                <strong>Scalability</strong>: Both Hetzner and GitHub Actions are designed to scale with the needs of your project. Whether you're running small-scale experiments or managing large-scale deployments, you can easily adjust resources and configurations to accommodate changes in workload and demand.<br/>

                                <strong>Integration</strong>: GitHub Actions seamlessly integrates with GitHub repositories, allowing developers to define CI/CD workflows directly within their code repositories. This tight integration simplifies the setup and management of automated build, test, and deployment processes.<br/>

                                <strong>Flexibility</strong>: Hetzner's cloud infrastructure provides a range of virtual machines, storage options, and networking capabilities, giving DevOps teams the flexibility to design and deploy custom solutions tailored to their specific requirements. GitHub Actions supports a wide variety of programming languages and frameworks, enabling teams to build, test, and deploy applications written in different technologies.<br/>

                                <strong>Automation</strong>: Both Hetzner and GitHub Actions emphasize automation, which is a fundamental principle of DevOps. With GitHub Actions, you can automate repetitive tasks such as code linting, testing, and deployment, while Hetzner's cloud platform offers APIs and automation tools for provisioning and managing infrastructure resources programmatically.<br/>

                                <strong>Reliability</strong>: Hetzner and GitHub Actions are backed by robust infrastructures and have a track record of reliability and uptime. This reliability is crucial for maintaining continuous integration and deployment pipelines, ensuring that development workflows remain smooth and uninterrupted.<br/>

                                <strong>Community Support</strong>: Both Hetzner and GitHub Actions have large and active communities of developers and DevOps practitioners. This means access to a wealth of resources, tutorials, and community-driven support channels where you can seek assistance, share knowledge, and learn best practices from peers.<br/>

                                <strong>Security</strong>: Both platforms prioritize security, offering features such as encryption, access controls, and monitoring tools to help safeguard your data and infrastructure against potential threats and vulnerabilities.<br/>

                                In summary, the combination of Hetzner and GitHub Actions provides a powerful and cost-effective solution for DevOps teams looking to streamline their development workflows, automate repetitive tasks, and deploy applications reliably and efficiently.<br/>

                            It would be nice if everyone can understand what is the difference between
                            these jobs.<br/>
                            Helpdesk typically deal with problems that involve the desktop/laptop and pheripherals
                            (mouse, headphone, and maybe even PRINTER (the devil if you know)), basically the work involves
                            more with the users.<br/>
                            Sysadmin keeps the whole IT infrastructure going, scripting, maintaining, updating the 
                            system so that it won't get down whenever happens (hacking,attacking). Logging and 
                            Data collecting are also part of your jobs incase your Product Owner/Technical IT Manager
                            demands it.<br/>
                            So now you understand what is the difference between two of them, then what will you choose?

                                I was wondering that myself too. In 2018-2019, during the time, 
                                I was working as an intern at Future Electronics in Munich. 
                                I had lots of opportunities to understand what can I do 
                                after finishing my degree in ET/IT.<br/>
                                I had lots of chance to tinkering with PCG from multiple famous manufacturers like NXP
                                , ON Semiconductor, Texas Instruments, etc. and it involves lots of embedding 
                                and C Programming. 
                                It was more fun for me to combine the PCB Boards with lots of sensors, 
                                and to see that it can do many types of application 
                                (like how the hell can the light turn on or the temps of your hand 
                                when you hover your hand?)<br/>
                                So yeah, it would be nice if EE can code, 
                                and of course it is possible that you can do that full time too.<br/>
